      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Composing music in Carnatic requires a good grasp of phrasing in Raga, Tala and good Vibes. You can choose to incorporate
      either of these elements to make music.</p>

      <h3 class="">Let's get started</h3>
      <p>Basically, all you need to make music using Carnatic theory on a computer is :</p>
      <p>1. A continuous Drone (Shruti)</p>
      <p>2. A Raga (a set of swaras) and a good grasp of it.</p>
      <p>3. Rhythm, Atmosphere, and FX to add context.</p>

      <h3>Buckle up</h3>
      <p >And you also need a Digital Audio workstation</p>
      <p>Like <a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a></p>
      <p>Or something like <a href="http://www.image-line.com/flstudio/" target="_blank">FL Studio</a></p>
      <p>Or if you're a musician on Apple computers, <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/logic-pro/" target="_blank">Logic Pro</a></p>
      <p>and lots of samples and plugin libraries (VST).</p>

      <h3>Lay the stuff together.</h3>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Depending on whether you're making an ambient track filled with sounds of <a href="https://foliage.shivacult.com">Foliage</a>
      or maybe a templated genre like '<i>Jungle</i>' or '<i>Dub</i>', plan up your track.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Feel the mood and contemplate upon it, getting inspired with the Shruti drone running in the background.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Surround yourself with Higher and positive Vibrations and request your followers on twitter to pour out
      blessings on your feed instead of nasty war politics.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Lay out Atmosphere on the Shruti and top it up with some Rhythm, FX and proceed towards Melody.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Make short phrases from a Raga chosen according to the feel. Use the <a href="#/">Raga Database</a> to pick the right Raga. Lay these phrases on the Rhythm. Mix and match.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Add sound FX, polish the track, EQ it and compress based on intuition.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Perform all these steps in a Zen way and preserve the aesthetics at all times.</p>
      <p class="paraBlueHighlight">Finish the track, export into high quality formats and thank the Universe for the good vibes.</p>
