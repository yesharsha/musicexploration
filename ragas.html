      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>A Raga arises out of a structured combination of Swaras. There's a very specific sequence to each.</p>
      <p>The notes S, P, S' are fixed for most ragas and for some, it is S, M, S'. It depends, really. There are exceptions.</p>
      <p>The ascending (<i>'Arohana'</i>) and descending sequences (<i>'Arohana'</i>) are then split into smaller phrases
      to make a composition. You can practice these smaller phrases to get a brief of the Raga's <i>Bhava</i> (Emotion). </p>
      <p>There are Ragas that consist of all the seven swaras. These are the complete ones with a lot of construct the <i>Bhava</i> with.
        We shall refer to a collection of these a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melakarta" target="_blank"><i>Melakarta</i></a>.
        This collection is a really cleverly defined scheme with a well structured combination and identification mechanism.</p>

      <h3>Other Ragas</h3>
      <p>As you might have guessed already, other ragas are mostly derivatives of these complete ragas from the <i>Melakarta</i> scheme.
      These derivatives (<i> Janya Ragas</i>) are a bunch of 4 - 5 Swaras that can be intricately combined.</p>
      <p>There are some terrific Ragas out there that have their own distinct personalities.</p>
      <p>Some Ragas can have you fantasize about Indian snake charmers and some Ragas can get you lost in the mountains of Kashmir.</p>

      <h3>Raga Database</h3>
      <p>The Raga database is a collection of interesting and fun facts about some of the oh-so-many Ragas in the Carnatic
      encyclopedia.</p>
      <p>As you expect, every entry here gives you the <i>'Arohana'</i> and the <i>'Arohana'</i> along with some sample phrases.</p>
      <p>You can remember the correct keys and practice playing these phrases on the virtual piano. Do not hesitate to search for the name of the Raga
      on a search engine to hear artists perform compositions.</p>
