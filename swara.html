      <h3>Introduction to <i>Swara</i></h3>
      <p>Swaras (pl): A collection of notes strung together to express a certain mood.</p>
      <h3>Common Sequence</h3>
      <p>Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni and the octave is continued again by a Sa.</p>
      <h3>Types</h3>
      <p>There are 16 types of swaras.</p>
      <h3>WHAT? HOW?</h3>
      <p>Yes, a standard piano has only 12 notes in one octave. Some swaras are faux-notes. For example, the Ri notes
      are represented as R1, R2 and R3. R3 is a faux-note which was supposed to sound like a Ga.</p>
      <h3>How do I learn the Swaras? Do I need to memorize them?</h3>
      <p>Tinker around with the common sequence of Swaras (Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, Sa). Play them in two sequences:
      an ascending sequence and a descending sequence.</p>
      <h3>What's the deal with these sequences?</h3>
      <p>The set of ascending and descending sequences takes us to the concept of Ragas. </p>
      <p>Eg. Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, Sa | Sa, Ni, Da, Pa, Ma, Ga, Ri, Sa ||</p>
      <h3>Exercises</h3>
      <p>Lets start by playing the white keys in an organized fashion.</p>
      <p>S R2 G3 M1 P D2 N3 S' | <br> S' N3 D2 P M1 G3 R2 S ||</p>
      <p>S R2 G3 M1 S R2 G3 M1 | <br> S R2 G3 M1 P D2 N3 S' ||<br>
         S' N3 D2 P S' N3 D2 P | <br> S' N3 D2 P M1 G3 R2 S ||</p>
